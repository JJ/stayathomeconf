Hey there and thank you for submitting your talk to StayAtHomeConf !!!

As you've probably heard, in the last weeks the world is struggling against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is causing COVID-19 disease. For this reason, a lot of governments are declaring a national emergency, limiting freedom of movement and asking the population to stay at home and WFH. As a consequence, several events, conferences and meetups have been cancelled.

StayAtHomeConf is here to help you with confinement and stream IT talks with the rest of the world.

Please fill out this CFP to be considered for a talk. We are looking for unique use cases, technical talks, culture talks, and demos focused on any IT topics.

StayAtHomeConf will be hosted on <date> beginning at <time> UTC and each speaker will have a 30 minute speaking slot. Please, it is important that the talk is no longer than 30 minutes.
