# stayathomeconf

stayathomeconf is a remote tech conference created to generate good quality talks and let people be distracted and technically up to date meanwhile the covid outbrake.



## This is a very early stage so... We need speakers!

We need speakers to the conference so if you want to give a talk PLEASE C4P is totally opened. Just open an issue and we will review the viability of doing the talk.
